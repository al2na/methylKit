abstract = {The pre-estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses ($\pi$(0)) plays a critical role in controlling false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing. However, hidden complex dependence structures of many genomics datasets distort the distribution of p-values, rendering existing $\pi$(0) estimators less effective.},

@article{Krueger2011,
abstract = {SUMMARY: A combination of bisulfite treatment of DNA and high-throughput sequencing (BS-Seq) can capture a snapshot of a cell's epigenomic state by revealing its genome-wide cytosine methylation at single base resolution. Bismark is a flexible tool for the time-efficient analysis of BS-Seq data which performs both read mapping and methylation calling in a single convenient step. Its output discriminates between cytosines in CpG, CHG and CHH context and enables bench scientists to visualize and interpret their methylation data soon after the sequencing run is completed. Availability and implementation: Bismark is released under the GNU GPLv3+ licence. The source code is freely available from www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/bismark/.},
