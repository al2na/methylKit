\title{Filter methylRaw and methylRawList object based on read coverage}
\usage{
filterByCoverage(methylObj,lo.count=NULL,lo.perc=NULL,hi.count=NULL,hi.perc=NULL)

\S4method{filterByCoverage}{methylRaw}(methylObj, lo.count = NULL,
  lo.perc = NULL, hi.count = NULL, hi.perc = NULL)

\S4method{filterByCoverage}{methylRawList}(methylObj, lo.count = NULL,
  lo.perc = NULL, hi.count = NULL, hi.perc = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{methylObj}{a \code{methylRaw} or \code{methylRawList} object}

\item{lo.count}{An integer for read counts.Bases/regions having lower coverage than this count is discarded}

\item{lo.perc}{A double [0-100] for percentile of read counts. Bases/regions having lower coverage than this percentile is discarded}

\item{hi.count}{An integer for read counts. Bases/regions having higher coverage than this is count discarded}

\item{hi.perc}{A double [0-100] for percentile of read counts. Bases/regions having higher coverage than this percentile is discarded}
}
\value{
\code{methylRaw} or \code{methylRawList} object depending on input object
}
\description{
This function filters \code{methylRaw} and \code{methylRawList} objects.
You can filter based on lower read cutoff or high read cutoff. Higher read cutoff is usefull to eliminate PCR effects
Lower read cutoff is usefull for doing better statistical tests.
}
\examples{
data(methylKit)

# filter out bases with covereage above 500 reads
filtered1=filterByCoverage(methylRawList.obj,lo.count=NULL,lo.perc=NULL,hi.count=500,hi.perc=NULL)

# filter out bases with cread coverage above 99.9th percentile of coverage distribution
filtered2=filterByCoverage(methylRawList.obj,lo.count=NULL,lo.perc=NULL,hi.count=NULL,hi.perc=99.9)
