\title{Pool replicates within groups to a single sample per group}
\usage{
pool(obj,sample.ids)

\S4method{pool}{methylBase}(obj, sample.ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{\code{methylBase} object with two groups or more and each group
should have multiple samples}

\item{sample.ids}{a character vector of new sample.ids ex:c("test","control"),
 should follow the same order as unique treatment vector,
and should be equal to the length of the unique treatment
 vector}
}
\value{
a  \code{methylBase} object
}
\description{
The function sums up coverage, numCs and numTs values within each group so
one representative sample for each group will be created in a new methylBase object
}
\examples{
library(methylKit)
data(methylKit)

# methylBase.obj has two groups, each group has two samples,
# the following function will pool the samples in each group
# so that each group will be represented by one pooled sample
pooled.methylBase=pool(methylBase.obj,sample.ids=c("test","control"))
