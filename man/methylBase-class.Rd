\title{An S4 class for methylation events sampled in multiple experiments}
\description{
This class is designed to contain methylation information such as coverage, number of methylated bases, etc..
The methylation events contained in the class must be sampled in multiple experiments (ex: only CpG bases covered in multiple experiments are stored in the object of this class).
The class extends \code{data.frame} and creates an object that holds methylation information and genomic location.
The object belonging to this class is produced by \code{\link{unite}} function.
}
\section{Slots}{
\describe{
                 \item{\code{sample.ids}:}{character vector for ids of samples in the object}

                 \item{\code{assembly}:}{name of the genome assembly}

                 \item{\code{context}:}{context of methylation. Ex: CpG,CpH,CHH, etc}

                 \item{\code{treatment}:}{treatment vector denoting which samples are test and control}

                 \item{\code{coverage.index}:}{vector denoting which columns in the data correspons to coverage values}

                 \item{\code{numCs.index}:}{vector denoting which columns in the data correspons to number of methylatedCs values}
                 \item{\code{numTs.index}:}{vector denoting which columns in the data correspons to number of unmethylated Cs values}
                 \item{\code{destranded}:}{ logical value. If \code{TRUE} object is destranded, if \code{FALSE} it is not.}
                 \item{\code{resolution}:}{ resolution of methylation information, allowed values: 'base' or 'region'}
}
}

\section{Details}{

\code{methylBase} class extends \code{\link{data.frame}} class therefore providing novice and experienced R users with a data structure that is well known and ubiquitous in many R packages.
}

\section{Subsetting}{

 In the following code snippets, \code{x} is a \code{methylDiff}.
 Subsetting by \code{x[i,]} will produce a new object if subsetting is done on
 rows. Column subsetting is not directly allowed to prevent errors in the
 downstream analysis. see ?methylKit[ .
}

\section{Accessors}{

The following functions provides access to data slots of methylDiff:
\code{\link[methylKit]{getData}},\code{\link[methylKit]{getAssembly}},
\code{\link[methylKit]{getContext}}
}

\section{Coercion}{

  \code{methylBase} object can be coerced to \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} object via \code{\link{as}} function.
}
\examples{
data(methylKit)
library(GenomicRanges)
my.gr=as(methylBase.obj,"GRanges")
