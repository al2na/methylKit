\title{An S4 class for overlap of target features with gene annotation}
\description{
This object is desgined to hold basic statistics and information about genomic feature overlaps. It extends \code{\link[methylKit]{annotationByFeature}} class.
The class contains an additional slot for data containing distance to nearest transcription start site (TSS).
