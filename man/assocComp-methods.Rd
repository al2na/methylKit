\title{Associate principal components with sample annotations}
\usage{
assocComp(mBase, sampleAnnotation)
}
\arguments{
\item{mBase}{\code{\link{methylBase}} object with no NA values in the data part.}

\item{sampleAnnotation}{a data frame where columns are different annotations and
                       rows are the samples, in the same order as in the methylBase object.}
}
\value{
a named list of principal component matrix (named 'pcs'),% variation explained
        by principal compopents (named 'vars') and a p-value matrix showing association
        p-values between sample annotations and principal components (named 'association').
}
\description{
This function associates principal components with sample annotations
such as age, gender, batch_id. Can be used to detect which batch effects
are associated with the variation in the methylation values.

sampleAnnotation=data.frame(batch_id=c("a","a","b","b"),age=c(19,34,23,40))
