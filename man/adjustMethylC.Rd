\title{Adjust measured 5mC levels using 5hmC levels}
\usage{
adjustMethylC(mc,hmc)

\S4method{adjustMethylC}{methylRaw,methylRaw}(mc, hmc)

\S4method{adjustMethylC}{methylRawList,methylRawList}(mc, hmc)

adjust.methylC(mc, hmc)

\S4method{adjust.methylC}{methylRaw,methylRaw}(mc, hmc)

\S4method{adjust.methylC}{methylRawList,methylRawList}(mc, hmc)
}
\arguments{
\item{mc}{a \code{methylRawList} or \code{methylRaw} containing 5mC levels of a sample or set of samples}

\item{hmc}{a \code{methylRawList} or \code{methylRaw} containing 5hmC levels of a sample or set of samples.
           If a \code{methylRawList} given the sample order should be same as "mc" \code{methylRawList} object.}
}
\value{
returns adjusted 5-methyl cytosine levels in the form of \code{methylRawList} or \code{methylRaw} object depending on the input object
}
\description{
Measured 5mC levels via bisulfite sequencing might be a combination of 5hmC and 5mC levels since bisulfite sequencing can not distinguish
between the two. This function can adjust 5mC levels of a bisulfite sequencing experiment
if the user supplies corresponding 5hmC levels from the same sample.
}
\examples{
# read 5hmC and 5mC files
hmc.file=system.file("extdata", "test1.myCpG.txt", package = "methylKit")
mc.file =system.file("extdata", "test2.myCpG.txt", package = "methylKit")

my5hmC=modRead( hmc.file,sample.id="hmc",assembly="hg18")
my5mC =modRead( mc.file,sample.id="mc",assembly="hg18")

# adjusting the 5mC levels using 5hmC levels
adjusted.5mC=adjustMethylC(my5mC,my5hmC)
