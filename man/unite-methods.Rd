\title{unite methylRawList to a single table}
\usage{
unite(object,destrand=FALSE,min.per.group=NULL)

\S4method{unite}{methylRawList}(object, destrand = FALSE,
  min.per.group = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a methylRawList object to be merged by common locations covered by reads}

\item{destrand}{if TRUE, reads covering both strands of a CpG dinucleotide will be merged,
do not set to TRUE if not only interested in CpGs (default: FALSE). If the methylRawList object
contains regions rather than bases setting destrand to TRUE will have no effect.}

\item{min.per.group}{an integer denoting minimum number of samples per replicate needed to cover a region/base. By default only regions/bases that are covered in all samples
       are united as methylBase object, however by supplying an integer for this argument users can control how many samples needed to cover region/base to be united as methylBase object.
      For example, if min.per.group set to 2 and there are 3 replicates per condition, the bases/regions that are covered in at least 2 replicates will be united and missing data for uncovered bases/regions will appear as NAs.}
}
\value{
a methylBase object
}
\description{
This functions unites \code{methylRawList} object that only bases with coverage from all samples are retained.
The resulting object is a class of \code{methylBase}
}
\examples{
data(methylKit)
 ## Following
 my.methylBase=unite(methylRawList.obj)
 my.methylBase=unite(methylRawList.obj,destrand=TRUE)
}
