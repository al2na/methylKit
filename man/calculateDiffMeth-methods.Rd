\title{Calculate differential methylation statistics}
\usage{
calculateDiffMeth(.Object,slim=TRUE,weighted.mean=TRUE,num.cores=1)

\S4method{calculateDiffMeth}{methylBase}(.Object, slim = TRUE,
  weighted.mean = TRUE, num.cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{.Object}{a methylBase object to calculate differential methylation}

\item{slim}{If TRUE(default) SLIM method will be used for P-value adjustment.
If FALSE, \code{\link{p.adjust}} with method="BH" option will be
used for P-value correction.}

\item{weighted.mean}{calculate the mean methylation difference between groups
using read coverage as weights}

\item{num.cores}{integer for denoting how many cores should be used for
differential methylation calculations (only can be used in
 machines with multiple cores)}
}
\value{
a methylDiff object containing the differential methylation
                     statistics and locations
}
\description{
The function calculates differential methylation statistics between two groups
of samples. The function uses either logistic regression test
or Fisher's Exact test to calculate differential methylation.
See references for detailed explanation on statistics.
}
\section{Details}{

 The function either uses a logistic regression
 (when there are multiple samples per group) or fisher's exact
 when there is one sample per group.
}
\examples{
data(methylKit)

# Logistic regression test will be applied since there are multiple samples in each group
# in methylBase.obj object
my.diffMeth=calculateDiffMeth(methylBase.obj,slim=TRUE,weighted.mean=TRUE,num.cores=1)

# P-value adjustment with Benjamini-Hocberg via p.adjust
my.diffMeth=calculateDiffMeth(methylBase.obj,slim=FALSE,weighted.mean=TRUE)

# pool samples in each group
pooled.methylBase=pool(methylBase.obj,sample.ids=c("test","control"))

# After applying pool() function, there is one sample in each group.
# Fisher's exact test will be applied for differential methylation
my.diffMeth2=calculateDiffMeth(pooled.methylBase,slim=TRUE,
                               weighted.mean=TRUE,num.cores=1)
