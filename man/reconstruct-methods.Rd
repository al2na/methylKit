\title{Reconstruct methylBase object based on a new methylation percentage matrix}
\usage{
reconstruct(methMat, mBase)
}
\arguments{
\item{methMat}{percent methylation matrix, row order and order of the samples
same as the methylBase object}

\item{mBase}{\code{\link{methylBase}} object to be reconstructed}
}
\value{
new \code{\link{methylBase}} object where methylation percentage matches
        input \code{methMat} and coverages matches input \code{mBase}
}
\description{
The function reconstructs a new methylBase object from an input methylBase object
and percent methylation matrix. Basically, it uses the read coverages in the input
methylBase object and deduces new number of methylated Cs and unmethylated Cs based
on the input percent methylation matrix. It is ideally to be used to
reconstruct methylBase objects
after batch correction on percent methylation values. The percent methylation
matrix rows must match methylBase object rows in order ,and in addition column
order (the order of samples) in input methylBase must match the order in
percent methylation matrix.
}
\note{
Batch effect correction (if any batch effect exists) is a tricky issue.
We provide some simple ways to deal with it
(see \code{\link{assocComp}} and \code{\link{removeComp}} ),
But if you can find other ways to correct for batch effects and want to create
a methylBase object with the corrected percent methylation values, you can use this function.
}
\examples{
data(methylKit)

# get percent methylation
mat=percMethylation(methylBase.obj)

# do some changes in the matrix
# this is just a toy example
# ideally you want to correct the matrix
# for batch effects
mat[mat==100]=80

# reconstruct the methylBase from the corrected matrix
newobj=reconstruct(mat,methylBase.obj)
