\title{Segment methylation or differential methylation profile}
\usage{
methSeg(obj, diagnostic.plot = TRUE, join.neighbours = FALSE,
  initialize.on.subset = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}}, \code{\link{methylDiff}}, 
\code{\link{methylDiffDB}}, \code{\link{methylRaw}} or 
\code{\link{methylRawDB}} . If the object is a 
\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} it should have one meta column 
with methylation scores and has to be sorted by position, 
i.e. ignoring the strand information.}

\item{diagnostic.plot}{if TRUE a diagnostic plot is plotted. The plot shows
methylation and length statistics per segment group. In addition, it 
shows diagnostics from mixture modeling: the density function estimated 
and BIC criterion used to decide the optimum number of components
in mixture modeling.}

\item{join.neighbours}{if TRUE neighbouring segments that cluster to the same 
seg.group are joined by extending the ranges, summing up num.marks and
averaging over seg.means.}

\item{initialize.on.subset}{a numeric value indicating either percentage or
absolute value of regions to subsample from segments before performing
the mixture modeling. The value can be either between 0 and 1, 
e.g. 0.1 means that 10% of data will be used for sampling, or be an 
integer higher than 1 to define the number of regions to sample. 
By default uses the whole dataset, which can be time consuming on 
large datasets. (Default: 1)}

\item{...}{arguments to \code{\link[fastseg]{fastseg}} function in fastseg 
package, or to \code{\link[mclust]{densityMclust}}
in Mclust package, could be used to fine tune the segmentation algorithm.
E.g. Increasing "alpha" will give more segments. 
Increasing "cyberWeight" will give also more segments."maxInt" controls
the segment extension around a breakpoint. "minSeg" controls the minimum
segment length. "G" argument
denotes number of components used in BIC selection in mixture modeling.
For more details see fastseg and Mclust documentation.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} object with segment 
        classification and information. 
       'seg.mean' column shows the mean methylation per segment.
       'seg.group' column shows the segment groups obtained by mixture modeling
}
\description{
The function uses a segmentation algorithm (\code{\link[fastseg]{fastseg}}) 
to segment the methylation profiles. Following that, it uses
gaussian mixture modelling to cluster the segments into k components. This process
uses mean methylation value of each segment in the modeling phase. Each
component ideally indicates quantitative classification of segments, such
as high or low methylated regions.
}
\details{
To be sure that the algorithm will work on your data, 
       the object should have at least 5000 records

After initial segmentation with fastseg(), segments are clustered 
       into self-similar groups based on their mean methylation profile 
       using mixture modeling. Mixture modeling estimates the initial 
       parameters of the distributions by using the whole dataset. 
       If "initialize.on.subset" argument set as described, the function 
       will use a subset of the data to initialize the parameters of the 
       mixture modeling prior to the Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm 
       used by \code{\link{Mclust}} package.
