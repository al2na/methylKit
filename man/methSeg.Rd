\title{Segment methylation or differential methylation profile}
\usage{
methSeg(obj, diagnostic.plot = TRUE, join.neighbours = FALSE,
  estimate.params.density = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}}, \code{\link{methylDiff}}, 
\code{\link{methylDiffDB}}, \code{\link{methylRaw}} or 
\code{\link{methylRawDB}} . If the object is a 
\code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} it should have one meta column 
with methylation scores and has to be sorted by position, 
i.e. ignoring the strand information.}

\item{diagnostic.plot}{if TRUE a diagnostic plot is plotted. The plot shows
methylation and length statistics per segment group. In addition, it 
shows diagnostics from mixture modeling: the density function estimated 
and BIC criterion used to decide the optimum number of components
in mixture modeling.}

\item{join.neighbours}{if TRUE neighbouring segments that cluster to the same 
seg.group are joined by extending the ranges, summing up num.marks and
averaging over seg.means.}

\item{estimate.params.density}{a numeric value indicating percentage of regions
to sample and then estimate initial parameters (G and modelName) for a
function to calculate density (\code{\link[mclust]{densityMclust}}). 
The value can be between 0 and 1, e.g. 0.1 means that 10% of data will 
be used for sampling, otherwise it uses the whole dataset (Default: 1) 
and it's time consuming on large datasets. If 0 or 1 then the function 
will be executed without sampling.}

\item{...}{arguments to \code{\link[fastseg]{fastseg}} function in fastseg 
package, or to \code{\link[mclust]{densityMclust}}
in Mclust package, could be used to fine tune the segmentation algorithm.
E.g. Increasing "alpha" will give more segments. 
Increasing "cyberWeight" will give also more segments."maxInt" controls
the segment extension around a breakpoint. "minSeg" controls the minimum
segment length. "G" argument
denotes number of components used in BIC selection in mixture modeling.
For more details see fastseg and Mclust documentation.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges}} object with segment 
        classification and information. 
       'seg.mean' column shows the mean methylation per segment.
       'seg.group' column shows the segment groups obtained by mixture modeling
}
\description{
The function uses a segmentation algorithm (\code{\link[fastseg]{fastseg}}) 
to segment the methylation profiles. Following that, it uses
gaussian mixture modelling to cluster the segments into k components. This process
uses mean methylation value of each segment in the modeling phase. Each
component ideally indicates quantitative classification of segments, such
as high or low methylated regions.
}
\details{
To be sure that the algorithm will work on your data, 
       the object should have at least 5000 records
