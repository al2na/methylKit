\usage{
getMethylDiff(.Object, difference = 25, qvalue = 0.01, type = "all",
  chunk.size = 1e+06, save.db = FALSE, ...)

\S4method{getMethylDiff}{methylDiff}(.Object, difference = 25,
  qvalue = 0.01, type = "all", chunk.size = 1e+06, save.db = FALSE,
  ...)

\S4method{getMethylDiff}{methylDiffDB}(.Object, difference = 25,
  qvalue = 0.01, type = "all", chunk.size = 1e+06, save.db = TRUE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.Object}{a \code{\link{methylDiff}} or \code{\link{methylDiffDB}} object}

\item{difference}{cutoff for absolute value of methylation percentage change 
between test and control (default:25)}

\item{qvalue}{cutoff for qvalue of differential methylation statistic 
(default:0.01)}

\item{type}{one of the "hyper","hypo" or "all" strings. Specifies what type 
of differentially menthylated bases/regions should be returned.
For retrieving Hyper-methylated regions/bases type="hyper", 
for hypo-methylated type="hypo" (default:"all")}

\item{chunk.size}{Number of rows to be taken as a chunk for processing the 
\code{methylDiffDB} objects (default: 1e6)}

\item{save.db}{A Logical to decide whether the resulting object should be 
saved as flat file database or not, default: see Details}

\item{...}{optional Arguments used when save.db is TRUE

\code{suffix}
      A character string to append to the name of the output flat 
      file database, 
      only used if save.db is true, default actions: append 
      \dQuote{_type} to current filename 
      if database already exists or generate new file with 
      filename \dQuote{methylDiff_type}
      
\code{dbdir} 
      The directory where flat file database(s) should be stored, 
      defaults
      to getwd(), working directory for newly stored databases
      and to same directory for already existing database
      
\code{dbtype}
     The type of the flat file database, currently only 
      option is "tabix"
      (only used for newly stored databases)}
}
\value{
a methylDiff or methylDiffDB object containing the differential 
methylated locations satisfying the criteria
}
\description{
The function subsets a \code{\link{methylDiff}} or \code{\link{methylDiffDB}} 
object in order to get 
differentially methylated bases/regions
satisfying thresholds.
}
\section{Details}{

The parameter \code{chunk.size} is only used when working with 
\code{methylDiffDB} objects, 
as they are read in chunk by chunk to enable processing large-sized objects 
which are stored as flat file database.
Per default the chunk.size is set to 1M rows, which should work for most 
systems. If you encounter memory problems or 
have a high amount of memory available feel free to adjust the \code{chunk.size}.

The parameter \code{save.db} is per default TRUE for methylDB objects as 
\code{methylDiffDB}, 
while being per default FALSE for \code{methylDiff}. If you wish to save 
the result of an 
in-memory-calculation as flat file database or if the size of the database 
allows the calculation in-memory, 
then you might want to change the value of this parameter.
