\title{Get the percentage/count of annotation features overlapping with target features}
\usage{
getFeatsWithTargetsStats(x,percentage=TRUE)

\S4method{getFeatsWithTargetsStats}{annotationByFeature}(x, percentage = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{\link[methylKit]{annotationByFeature}} or an \code{\link[methylKit]{annotationByGenicParts}} object}

\item{percentage}{TRUE|FALSE. If TRUE percentage of annotation features will be returned. If FALSE, number of annotation features will be returned}
}
\value{
a vector of percentages or counts showing quantity of annotation features overlapping with target features
}
\description{
This function retrieves percentage/number of annotation features overlapping with targets.
For example, if \code{annotationByFeature}  object is containing statistics of differentially methylated
regions overlapping with gene annotation. This function will return number/percentage of introns,exons and promoters
overlapping with differentially methylated regions.
}
