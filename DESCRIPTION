    bisulfite sequencing results

Description: methylKit is an R package for DNA methylation analysis and
  annotation from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. The package is designed 
  to deal with sequencing data from RRBS and its variants, but also target-capture 
  methods and whole genome bisulfite sequencing. It also has functions to analyze 
  base-pair resolution 5hmC data from experimental protocols such as oxBS-Seq 
  and TAB-Seq. Perl is needed to read SAM files only.
