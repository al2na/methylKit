Description: methylKit is an R package for DNA methylation analysis and
    annotation from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. The package is
    designed to deal with sequencing data from RRBS and its variants, but also
    target-capture methods and whole genome bisulfite sequencing. It also has
    functions to analyze base-pair resolution 5hmC data from experimental
    protocols such as oxBS-Seq and TAB-Seq. Perl is needed to read SAM files
    only.
