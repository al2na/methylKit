    (description
     "methylKit is an R package for DNA methylation analysis and
annotation from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing.  The package is
designed to deal with sequencing data from RRBS and its variants, but
also target-capture methods and whole genome bisulfite sequencing.  It
also has functions to analyze base-pair resolution 5hmC data from
experimental protocols such as oxBS-Seq and TAB-Seq.  Perl is needed
to read SAM files only.")
